Vacation tracker.

Aim: to account employee vacations within a company.

Basic user scenario:
- user login to the system
- check her vacation balance
-- should be a calendar like view at least month wide
-- holidays from past should be visible for record on the calendar view as well as in tabular format
- decides which day to take off
-- could be half a day
-- could be just a draft of holiday request, yet to be publish to supervisor (not sure do we need this feature)
-- should the system show vacations of users peers? Probably this feature should be configurable per company
- submit request to supervisor for approval
- when decision on vacation request is done: user gets email notification; in case of approval - send another email with calendar event for user to feed into her calendar 

Non admin users can recall holiday requests if the changed their minds.
Recalls needs to be approved if they happened in past. 
Scenario:
- user login into system
- selects existing request and perform "recall" action
-- if the request was for future, simply close it
--- as a result it should be removed from admins queue for approval
--- if admin user opens this request from link in email - the system should tell her that request was recalled
--- if the request was already approved, admin should be notified via email
-- in case of request was in the past
--- request moves to "waits for recall approval" status
--- admin notified via email
--- request recall is added to the admins queue for approval
--- request is removed only after admin approve its cancelation

Admin basic view:
- receives email notification about new holiday request from one from her team
- open system: on the dashboard list of requests for approval
-- put this list on the calendar like view with information about absents of other team members, it is easy to see who else is going to be on vacation at certain dates
-- requests to be approved and already approved are shown in different colours
-- queue of request for approval could be seen as a list
- in case of inconvenient holiday request, mark it as rejected with ability to put some comments about reason
-- corresponding employee is emailed with notification
- in case of approving request: press approve button
-- request is marked as approved and is visible for a record
-- user is emailed with confirmation
-- user is emailed with calendar feed


Implements users to have only one person that approves their vacations.

Admins can cancel request at any point.
